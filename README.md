Repository for hello-world - to learn how to use github

Hello - this is the first repository I have created on github. I am in the process of learning data analysis skills through DataQuest, with one of the set of skills being how to use git and github to maintain project code.

I am now using git on my local pc. I have cloned the repository hello-world from the github Website to my own directory. This change will now be committed and merged back to the main repository.
